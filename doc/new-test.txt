How to add a new test
=====================

Where to add a new test
-----------------------

Depending on what you want to test, it can be added in different places.

There are two categories of tests that we are running:

- The tor browser unit tests. Those tests are included in the tor browser
  sources tree, in tor-browser.git, and can only be run from the sources
  tree. We are currently running all the xpcshell and mozmill tests
  that we find in the sources tree.

- The tor browser bundle tests. Those tests are run on a complete bundle.
  The tests in the browser can be implemented using mozmill or selenium.
  We also have other types of tests checking that pluggable transports
  are working with and without using an http proxy, or checking that
  binary files have been compiled with hardenning options.

If the goal is to check that the behavior of the browser is correct
after some changes from one of our patches, then it is probably a good
idea to have the test as a patch on tor-browser.git. The Mozilla wiki
has some documentation about adding mochitest and XPCShell tests.

If the goal is to check the behavior of something that could be changed
by an extension included in the bundle, some build options or some
settings, then it should be included in the bundle tests. How to add
this kind of test is described below.


Adding a browser bundle test
----------------------------

The list of tests to be run by the test suite is defined in file
'TBBTestSuite/BrowserBundleTests.pm' in the '@tests' variable.

Each test is defined with the following properties:

name::
        The name of the test. For 'mozmill', 'selenium' and 'tor_bootstrap'
        tests this name is used to find the test filename.

type::
        The type of tests. This can be 'mozmill', 'selenium',
        'tor_bootstrap', 'command', or something else if you want to
        write the test in perl. In the later case, you need to define
        it in the '%test_types' variable.

descr::
        A short description.

fail_type::
        The default is 'error'. If you set this to 'fatal', when this
        test fails the following tests are not run. If you set this to
        'warning', failure of this test does not fail the report.

pre::
        A reference to a perl subroutine that will be run before the
        test.

post::
        A reference to a perl subroutine that will be run after the
        test.

enable::
        A reference to a perl subroutine that should return false when
        the test should be skipped.


Adding a mozmill test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new test based on mozmill, you will add something like this in
'TBBTestSuite/BrowserBundleTests.pm':

----
    {
        name  => 'example-test',
        type  => 'mozmill',
        descr => 'Example mozmill test',
    },
----

The mozmill test files are stored in the directory
'mozmill/mozmill-tests/tbb-tests/'. The name of the file is the name
of the test with '.js' at the end, unless mozmill_test is defined, in
which case it is used instead of the name.

It is possible to share a single mozmill file for multiple tests. The
mozmill test can access values from the test definition to do something
different in each test. It is also possible to access the test suite options.
In this example, we are accessing the "timeout" value from the test
definition, and the "test_data_url" from the the testsuite options:

----
var testsuite = require("../lib/testsuite");

var testThings = function() {
    var test_data_url = testsuite.options.test_data_url;
    var timeout = testsuite.test.timeout;
    ...
}
----

A common option is 'test_data_url' which is an URL where test data have
been deployed. If you want to add more data, it should be added to the
'test-data' directory at the root of the repository.

If the test data does not need to be accessed remotely, the 'test_data_dir'
option can be used instead.


Adding a simple test page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If what you want to test is the behavior of some specific page and you
don't need any of the mozmill specific features, you can reuse the
'test_page' mozmill test.

To do that, put your page in the directory 'test-data'. The name of the
test will be the name of the page without the '.html' extension.

Your page will do something in javascript, and save its result in an
element whose id is 'test_result'. If the test is successful, the result
should be "OK", and anything else will be considered as an error message
and a failed test.

Adding a successful test result can be done like this:
----
var result = document.createElement('div');
result.innerHTML = 'OK';
result.setAttribute("id", "test_result");
document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0].appendChild(result);
----

The test definition will look like this:
----
    {
        name => 'some_name',
        type => 'mozmill',
        descr => 'Some description',
        mozmill_test => 'test_page',
        remote => 1,
        timeout => 50000,
        interval => 100,
    },
----

If 'remote' is set to 1, then the page will be accessed using the URL
defined in the 'test_data_url' option, otherwise it will be accessed
locally with the 'test_data_dir' option.

The 'timeout' value is the time in milliseconds after which the test
should be considered as failed if the 'test_result' element is still
not present.

The 'interval' value is how often we should check if the test_result
element appeared.


Adding a selenium test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new test based on selenium webdriver, you will add something
like this in 'TBBTestSuite/BrowserBundleTests.pm':

----
    {
        name  => 'example-test',
        type  => 'selenium',
        descr => 'Example selenium test',
    },
----

The selenium test files are stored in the directory 'selenium-tests'.
The name of the file that will be executed is 'test_$name.py' (with
$name replaced by the test name).


Adding a command test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a command on some files, and check the output. You will add
something like this in 'TBBTestSuite/BrowserBundleTests.pm':

----
    {
        name         => 'readelf_RELRO',
        type         => 'command',
        descr        => 'Check if binaries are RELocation Read-Only',
        files        => [ 'Browser/firefox', 'Tor/tor', ],
        command      => [ 'readelf', '-l' ],
        check_output => sub { $_[0] =~ m/GNU_RELRO/ },
    },
----

The 'command' option is the command that should be run. The 'files'
option is the list of files on which it should be run. If 'files' is a
reference to a subroutine, then it is expected to return an array
reference containing the files list. The 'check_output' is optional and
is a reference to a subroutine that checks the output of the command.
The test will fail if the command returns non-zero, or the check_output
sub returns false, on any of the files.


Testing the new test
--------------------

When you are creating a new test, you probably don't want to run all
the tests to try your new test. In this case, the '--enable-tests'
option is useful to run only the test that you added:

----
$ ./tbb-testsuite --no-newlayout --enable-tests my_new_test /path/to/tor-browser-linux64-3.6.6_ko.tar.xz
----

If your test requires a running Tor daemon, you may need to enable the 'tor_bootstrap' test too:
----
$ ./tbb-testsuite --no-newlayout --enable-tests tor_bootstrap,my_new_test /path/to/tor-browser-linux64-3.6.6_ko.tar.xz
----

Alternatively you may use an already running Tor daemon with the '--tor-socks-port' option:
----
$ ./tbb-testsuite --no-newlayout --enable-tests my_new_test --tor-socks-port=9150 /path/to/tor-browser-linux64-3.6.6_ko.tar.xz
----
